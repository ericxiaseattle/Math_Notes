\section{Torque}

    \subsection{Torque and Angular Momentum}

        \textbf{Torque}: the ability of a force to rotate an object about an axis \\
        $\bullet$ is the rotational analog of force, i.e. forces cause (translational) acceleration and torques cause rotational acceleration about an axis \\

        \textit{In general, for a stationary object, the sum of the torques is zero.}

    \subsection{Free Rotation}

        \textbf{Free rotation:} the rotation of objects that are not constrained by a physical axis or by other external constraints \\

        \textit{In general, objects that are made to rotate without external constraints always rotate about the centre of mass}.

    \subsection{Extended Free-body Diagrams}

        \textbf{Extended free-body diagram:} a diagram that shows not only the forces exerted on an object but also the location of the point of application of each force relative to some chosen reference point.
