\section{Cons. of Angular Momentum}

    \subsection{The Vectorial Nature of Rotation}

        \textbf{The right-hand rule:} when you curl the fingers of your right hand along the direction of rotation, your thumb points in the direction of the vector that specifies the direction of rotation.

        \textbf{Axial vectors:} vectors associated with a direction of rotation \\
        \textbf{Polar vectors:} vectors derived from the displacement vector

    \subsection{Conservation of Angular Momentum}

        The magnitude of torque is denoted by $\tau$ (tau) and given by

        \[
            \tau = rF\sin{\theta} = r_{\bot} F = rF_{\bot}
        \]

        Additionally, we have the \textbf{rotational equation of motion:}

        \[
            \tau_{\text{script }\theta} = I\alpha_{\text{script }\theta}
        \]

        \textbf{Rotational equilibrium:} when an object's angular momentum is constant, i.e. the sum of the torques caused by the forces exerted on the object is zero \\
        \textbf{Mechanical equilibrium:} an object that is in both translational and rotational equilibrium:

        \[
            \sum \tau_{\text{ext script}\theta} = 0 \text{ and } \sum \vec{F}_{\text{ext}}=\vec{0} \iff \text{ mechanical equilibrium}
        \]

        For a system that is not in rotational equilibrium, we have the \textbf{angular momentum law:}

        \[
            \Delta L_{\text{script }\theta} = J_{\text{script }\theta},
        \]

        where $J_{\text{script }\theta}$ is the \textbf{rotational impulse} delivered to the system, i.e. the transfer of angular momentum from the environment to the system. \\

        \textbf{The Rotational Impulse Equation:}

        \[
            J_{\text{script }\theta} = \left(\sum \tau_{\text{ext script }\theta}\right) \Delta t \text{ (constant torques)}
        \]
