        \color{blue} \textit{Example 1: You are in a tall building, looking out the window 35 metres above ground. You toss a tomato vertically up at an initial speed of 10 meters per second. Ignoring air resistance,
        when will the tomato reach its maximum height, what is the maximum height and when will it hit the ground? What is the distance the tomato travels until it hits the ground?} \color{black} \\
