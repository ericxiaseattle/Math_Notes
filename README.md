|PHYS122 (incomplete)|[PHYS122.pdf](https://github.com/ericxiaseattle/Notes/raw/master/Physics/PHYS122/out/PHYS122_Notes.pdf)|Electromagnetism: Covers the basic principles of electromagnetism and experiments in these topics for physical science and engineering majors.|

*Notes: My PHYS122 notes are incomplete and I have no plans to finish them. This is because I felt that taking notes was not an effective way for me to learn physics, as it felt like I was simply rewording the textbook when I took notes.*
